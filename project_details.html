    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    The **Smart City Traffic Management System** is an innovative solution designed to enhance urban mobility by integrating IoT devices, advanced algorithms, and real-time analytics. The system offers a range of features to address modern traffic challenges. Real-time traffic monitoring is achieved through IoT sensors that collect and process live data to identify congestion and traffic patterns. A dedicated citizen feedback platform ensures that traffic-related concerns are analyzed and addressed effectively. Smart traffic signals dynamically adjust their timings based on traffic flow, reducing delays and improving efficiency. For parking solutions, a Trie data structure is used to manage and update parking space availability in real time, providing instant updates to users. Emergency vehicle routing is optimized using a 2-3 Tree, ensuring minimal delays for ambulances and fire trucks.<\p> Additionally, the system supports sustainable practices by managing EV charging stations across the city, ensuring optimal utilization and easy access for electric vehicle users.<\p> By combining cutting-edge technologies, this system improves traffic flow, prioritizes safety, supports eco-friendly initiatives, and enhances the overall urban experience.<\p>
